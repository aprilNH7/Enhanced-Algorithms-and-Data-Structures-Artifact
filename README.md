# 2. Enhanced 3D Pyramid Program â€“ CS-330: Graphics and Visualization

# Overview
The original 3D Pyramid program was transformed into a more scalable and modular graphics application. It uses OpenGL for rendering and applies object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and GLM for matrix transformations.

# Key Enhancements
Modular Buffer Management: Introduced a Buffer class to centralize buffer operations.
Dynamic Object Handling: Added std::vector for managing multiple 3D objects.
Error Handling in Shader Compilation: Improved detection and reporting of shader errors.
Optimized Matrix Operations: Applied the GLM library for efficient transformations.

# Challenges Addressed
Resource Management: Centralized buffer operations improved memory handling.
Improved Code Readability: Modular design made the code easier to maintain and extend.
Efficient Rendering: Handling multiple objects dynamically improved performance.
